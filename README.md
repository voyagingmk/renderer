# Raytrace Renderer Demo
A C++11 based Raytrace Renderer Demo

All of the works base on this article written by Milo [用JavaScript玩转计算机图形学1，光线追踪入门](http://www.cnblogs.com/miloyip/archive/2010/03/29/1698953.html)。

## How to Build:

The **Makefile** is handwritten and unfinished, but there's a Makefile.win which is generated by the Dev-C++ IDE.

So you could compile it by yourself or use the Makefile.win or just run the demo by Dev-C++.

I write this demo on Windows, never on other platforms, but I've considered the cross-platform problems.

In order to let it runs on Mac or Linux, I only use standard C++ and a fantasitic third-party image library——CImg.

The code hasn't been optimized and it's not robust. It's a demo, you know. :)
